# Startup Questions

A long list of questions for startups with crowdsourced answers.

## Node / NPM

##### What is npm?

npm (node package manager) is the dependency/package manager you get out of the box when you install Node.js. It provides a way for developers to install packages both globally and locally.

##### What is npx?

Sometimes you might want to take a look at a specific package and try out some commands. But you cannot do that without installing the dependencies in your local `node_modules` folder. Since npm version 5.2.0 npx is pre-bundled with npm.

npx make it easy to install and manage dependencies hosted in the npm registry. You can use npx to run any GitHub gists and repositories.
